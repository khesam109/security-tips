* PEM or Privacy Enhanced Mail is a Base64 encoded DER certificate.
* Many cryptography standards use ASN.1 to define their data structures, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) to serialize those structures.
* Because DER produces binary output, it can be challenging to transmit the resulting files through systems, like electronic mail, that only support ASCII.
* The PEM format solves this problem by encoding the binary data using base64.
* PEM certificates are frequently used for web servers as they can easily be translated into readable data using a simple text editor.
* PEM also defines a one-line header, consisting of -----BEGIN, a label, and -----, and a one-line footer, consisting of -----END, a label, and -----. 
* The label determines the type of message encoded. Common labels include CERTIFICATE, CERTIFICATE REQUEST, PRIVATE KEY and X509 CRL.
* PEM data is commonly stored in files with a ".pem" suffix, a ".cer" or ".crt" suffix (for certificates), or a ".key" suffix (for public or private keys).
* The label inside a PEM file represents the type of the data more accurately than the file suffix, since many different types of data can be saved in a ".pem" file.
* A PEM file may contain multiple instances. For instance, an operating system might provide a file containing a list of trusted CA certificates, or a web server might be configured with a "chain" file containing an end-entity certificate plus a list of intermediate certificates.
