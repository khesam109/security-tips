* In cryptography, PKCS #12 defines an archive file format for storing many cryptography objects as a single file.
* It is commonly used to bundle a private key with its X.509 certificate or to bundle all the members of a chain of trust.
* It may not include private key. For instance PKCS #12 file can be used to store trsutstore.
* A PKCS #12 file may be encrypted and signed.
* PKCS #12 is one of the family of standards called Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) published by RSA Laboratories.
* The filename extension for PKCS #12 files is .p12 or .pfx.
* These files can be created, parsed and read out with the OpenSSL pkcs12 command.
